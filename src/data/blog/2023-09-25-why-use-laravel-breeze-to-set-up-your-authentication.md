Unlike other Auth libraries, Breeze is a starter kit. This means after installing it and setting it up you donâ€™t need the library in your `composer.json` file and you can safely delete it.

It gives you 2 big advantages:

### 1\. Less Dependencies

Your `composer.json` doesnâ€™t need to carry another library and you donâ€™t need to be worried about updates.

### 2\. Customizable

After publishing Breezeâ€™s files in your app you can customize the code. Breeze even publishes the routes `auth.php` in your `routes` folder so you can modify them if you want.

### Breeze offers moreÂ now

Taylor announced that Breeze now supports Livewire out of the box!

* Blade with Alpine
    
* Livewire with Alpine
    
* React with Inertia
    
* Vue with Inertia
    
* API only
    

### How it can be evenÂ cooler?

IMO it would be cooler if Breeze was also able to support 2FA so you donâ€™t need to install Fortify.

What do you think about this?
