[Capty](https://capty.app) is a professional screen capture application for macOS that allows you to take screenshots and record your screen with audio. It comes with a powerful built-in editor that lets you annotate, beautify, and share your captures easily.

## The need

It was one of my dream projects because I was always struggling with a good screen capture tool that does both screenshot and screen recording well with no crazy pricing!

I used to use CleanshotX and Screen Studio in the same time and was missing both worlds in one app. So I decided to build Capty to solve this problem for myself and others.

And of couswe, I wanted to make it affordable for everyone.

## Features

These are just a brief list of features that Capty offers:

- Area, window, and full screen capture
- Hide desktop icons for clean screenshots
- Annotation tools: pen, text, arrows, shapes, numbering, redact, crop, blur
- Wallpaper studio with gradients, custom backgrounds, and presets
- Screen recording with system audio and microphone
- Camera overlay with flexible placement
- Pause and resume recording
- Video editor with cursor effects and zoom animations
- Export to PNG, JPEG, MP4, GIF
- Resolutions up to 4K, frame rates up to 60 FPS
- OCR text capture
- QR code scanner
- Capture history with Vim keys navigation
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces)
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Universal Binary (Intel & Apple Silicon)

## Tech Stack

Capty uses Electron with React and a lot of native macOS modules in Swift.

An almost large Swift daemon project is living inside the app to handle all the native macOS functionalities like screen capturing, recording, audio handling, and more.

### Screenshots

For the screenshots it uses `screencapture` from macOS and some custom swift modules for some scenarios.

### Screen Recording

For the screen recording part, I have built a custom Swift module that uses `AVFoundation` framework to capture the screen and audio.

For the exporting videos, It uses Webcodecs API with a mixed of `ffmpeg`.
