Until two years ago I was listening to any kind of music very normally :) until I got introduced to Post-Rock! After that, I wasn't that normal person with a normal music taste anymore 😅. This post is about how this happened.

Yes! This is not a tech blog post like the usual 😅.

Two years ago I came to Germany for work and met [Mahdi](https://hazaveh.net/) at work and we became really good friends but that's a different story.

One day after a very hard working day we went for a beer in the office and Mahdi played some songs on his phone and talked about Post-Rock I was like "Dude just play something chill 😅" and he said just listen to a few of them later on.

Anyway, The same day I was heading off home, and on the way I played a few Post-Rock songs. Believing or not I was gone into the music so bad that I forgot to get off the bus!

Since that time my music taste changed completely!

## That was it?!

Well, This post is not only about my music taste! I wanna talk more about this music genre and an amazing website 😍

Mahdi recently introduced his new website [PostRockNation](https://postrocknation.com/)! Good for him tho 😅🎉

## What is PostRockNation?

According to the website:

> The platform dedicated to the exploration and celebration of Post-Rock music

It is indeed! but let me break it down a bit as the first user of this website 😃.

I can say that PostRockNation is the first website that aims to be the source directory of post-rock music! I am so glad this website is out there because the post-rock genre is not that popular!

### Bands

PostRockNation almost includes all of the bands doing Post-Rock!

You can find them on [the website](https://postrocknation.com/bands), well organized and easy to find via the powerful search bar!

Don't miss the [Largest Post-Rock release archive](https://postrocknation.com/page/release-archive)!

Also, you can [discover](https://postrocknation.com/discover) bands if you think you are lucky 🤞

### Band Management

This is a unique feature for Bands! So Bands can sign up there and manage their page by themselves and have a close touch with their fans in the community!

### Songs

So literally I listen to music now through PostRockNation 😅! There is a very nice integration between Spotify and if you are logged in to your Spotify, You can easily listen to music on the website which is awesome no?

Also, PostRockNation has integration for many of the music listening platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Dizzer, and Youtube and you can find the songs on most of those platforms!

### Community

This is my favorite one! Mahdi has implemented an amazing community platform into the website so you can get to know other post-rock fans and talk to them!

There is a lot to talk about this amazing service but I would let you discover them by yourself!

So head off to the website
