My name is Saeed Vaziry. I am a software engineer since 2012! I work as a tech lead in the e-commerce and payment industry by day ‚òÄÔ∏è and a developer who builds FREE and open-source projects by night üåô.

## Tech Stack

I am focused on PHP and Laravel but after +10 years of experience in the software industry, I can adopt to any tech stack easily.
